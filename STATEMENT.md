# Problem Statement

Many people forget to drink enough water during the day, which leads to dehydration, fatigue, and reduced productivity. Despite having busy schedules, individuals often need a simple reminder system that keeps track of their water intake and motivates them to maintain healthy hydration levels.


This project is intended to develop an automated reminder system in Python to remind users at periodic intervals about their hydration habits.



# Project Scope

**With the system, the user can set:**

* Custom start hour

* Custom end hour

* Minute interval for reminders


**In this timeframe, the system:**

* Sends periodic reminders

* Asks the user whether they drank water

* Tracks total reminders and successful hydration actions

* Calculates hydration efficiency (%)

* Generates a visual hydration performance chart





# Target Users

**This solution is ideal for the:**

* Students

* Office workers

* Programmers

* Fitness-conscious people

* Anyone wanting to build a hydration habit



# High-Level Features

* Configurable start & end time

* Custom reminder interval

* Beep sound notification for every reminder

* Input validation: accepts only Y/N

* Calculation of hydration percentage

* **Time-based hydration performance tracking

* Line chart visualization (Matplotlib) Lightweight and simple Python script
